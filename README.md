## Cloudflare Gateway Pi-hole Scripts (CGPS)

Cloudflare Gateway allows you to create custom rules to filter HTTP, DNS, and network traffic based on your firewall policies. This is a collection of scripts that can be used to get a similar experience as if you were using Pi-hole, but with Cloudflare Gateway - so no servers to maintain or need to buy a Raspberry Pi!

Repository created following instructions [here](https://github.com/mrrfv/cloudflare-gateway-pihole-scripts?tab=readme-ov-file#running-in-github-actions).
